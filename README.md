# Canvas Viewer - Visualize Your AI Product Workflow

The Canvas Viewer is a service application designed to visualize data generated by our AI Product Workflow project. It takes JSON files exported from the AI Product Workflow App and renders them as interactive mind maps on a canvas. These mind maps illustrate the process of creating moodboards, analyzing products, and generating AI prompts for image creation.

## Here’s how it works:

1. **AI Product Workflow Export:** The AI Product Workflow app produces JSON data representing moodboards and product descriptions.

2. **Canvas Visualization:** The Canvas Viewer ingests this JSON data and displays it as a visually engaging mind map, connecting images and nodes to represent the workflow stages.

3. **Touch-Enabled Interface:** The viewer supports touch input, making it ideal for use on tablets and smartphones.

## Technical Details:

- Dependencies: NodeJS (required)
- Installation: `npm install`
- Running Locally: `npm run dev` or visit the web page at https://polite-mooncake-195925.netlify.app/
